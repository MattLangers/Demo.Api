Simple Authentication Implementation

This API is an example of how we can implement a very simple layer of authentication. When a client engages with the api we have some middleware to authenticat the request. Doing this allows us to ensure all requests are conforming to our authentication requirements. This is only an example, and may not be right for a fully functional production product.

### Postman collection
At the route of this repo, you will find a postman collection for engaging with this API. I have included some tests within each request, that utilise postman bdd: https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/220187/postman-bdd-examples/6Z3uY71 You will need to install the JSON variable for these to work.
